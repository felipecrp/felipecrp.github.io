Nowadays, ransomware is likely to be a common nightmare among infrastructure and security managers. Once on the network, the malware attempts to penetrate the infrastructure, typically abusing vulnerabilities, to encrypt the company's entire infrastructure. Then, the attackers ask for a ransom. The value depends on the company but usually adds up to millions of dollars. Ransomware looks like something from a movie, but it happens in real life - more than we would like. Many companies have no alternative and must pay the ransom.

We need to discuss the solutions. <!--more--> Many senior managers would argue that the solution is related to keep an offline backup or an offline alternative datacenter. These controls clearly help at recovering the infrastructure and in most circumstances they can avoid paying the ransom. In fact, they may be an essential part of any ransomware remediation plan. However, even with the best offline copy available, the ransomware will still interrupt the company operation and will lead to data loss - there is no offline backup solution with zero recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).

Security should be more about prevention than remediation. Hence, we really need to discuss solutions to avoid or reduce the ransomware attack risk. There is no silver bullet and the hackers will continue to use ransomwares until the companies manage to prevent damage from this type of attack.

In my opinion, the solution comes with the change of the infrastructure team operation culture. In many companies, the system administrators have full access to every server.

The infrastructure administrators can access the server directly through their machines.
