I have been working on security, infrastructure, DevOps teams for a long to know that some unplanned tasks may easily break a well-crafted board. Hence, I would like to share some insights about how to create a kanban board.

Most of the literature I have read describes boards geared towards development teams. These boards generally comprise columns related to code, test and deploy activites. Sometimes, these boards also include a colum related to planning activities, where the team intends to break large generic histories (i.e., epics) into smaller detailed histories.

While these boards can work pretty well for developer teams, they generally do not fit at all for security, infrastructure, and devops teams, because tha type of work is very different. First, developer teams tend to focus on delivery features of product.
