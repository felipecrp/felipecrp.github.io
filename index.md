I´m Ph.D. Student at the Computing Institute of Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) and Infrastructure IT Leader at Brazillian Development Bank.  

My broad research area is software engineering, and my current research project is in continuous software engineering, software release evolution, and software development and operation integration, i.e., DevOps. The questions that motivate this research include:
  - What are the effects of continuous software engineering on software quality and collaboration?
  - What are the benefits and perils of continuous software engineering?
  - How to enable continuous software development?

I´m also interested in topics like software repository mining, feature toggles, software quality, software collaboration, development metrics, automation, and information security, mostly in secure software development and access control.
